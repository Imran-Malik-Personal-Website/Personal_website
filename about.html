            <h1>Building</h1>
            <p>For as long as I can remember I have always loved creating and building new things. 
                Be it playing with Legos as a child or building PCs and doing basic home upgrades as an adult. 
                Most recently I have really enjoyed learning about and doing more software development. 
                throughout my personal and professional life, I have learned to build many things, as an AWS Datatech 
                I can take apart and put back together multiple server types. I have a good grasp on python and I’m now moving on to JavaScript 
                and when I’m done with that I will probably move on to a new subject.

            <h1>Reading</h1>
            <p>
                You can’t learn without reading and luckily, I love to read, it doesn’t matter what the subject is. 
                I have gone through so many fiction books from wizards and dragons to haunted houses 
            </p>

        <section class="Sports">
            <!-- about 3 -->
            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <p>I would love to say that being active has been a constant in my life, 
                but it hasn’t I will have times where I’m active everyday for months and 
                then life will catch and I will have to manage my time more wisely and sadly physical activity 
                and sports end up taking the worst of it. But when I do have time I’m always ready to work out or try a new sport, 
                when I was younger I played for my schools basketball team and then in high school I played a lot of 
                cricket with my cousin who had moved to America from Pakistan, and as of typing this a friend of mine has 
                introduced me to pickleball and we end up playing at least one a week, I have pulled multiple muscles and been 
                sore every morning after playing but I love it.
