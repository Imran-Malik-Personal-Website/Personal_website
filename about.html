        <h1>Building</h1>
        <p>For as long as I can remember I have always loved creating and building new things. 
            Be it playing with Legos as a child or building PCs and doing basic home upgrades as an adult. 
            Most recently I have really enjoyed learning about and doing more software development. 
            throughout my personal and professional life, I have learned to build many things, as an AWS Datatech 
            I can take apart and put back together multiple server types. I have a good grasp on python and I’m now moving on to JavaScript 
            and when I’m done with that I will probably move on to a new subject.</p>
